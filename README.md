"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional offense.‚Äù

Implementation of Builder Pattern:

An OrientationBuilder Pattern implements all the functions of the student orientation program. Basically, this class creates and combines all objects of all activities and compiles them to create the entire orientation plan. The OrientationWorkshop is used to implement this blue-print of the Orientation using the createOrientation() method. The Orientation Builder accepts Enums in the following manner/order:-
OrientationBuilder(Mode of transport for Building 1,Mode of transport for Building 1, Cafeteria , Gift Location , Lecture type)
Interfaces have been created for different activities as further extensions would be easier.
